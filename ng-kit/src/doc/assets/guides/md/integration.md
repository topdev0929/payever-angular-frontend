# INTEGRATION

Integration it's inseparable part of the payever Payments App.

To provide for our customers an ability of easy payments integration we've developed payever payments REST API. It's easy and clear way to start with payments in shortest terms.

Payments api contains methods for payments management and payments status changed notifications.

Payever payments REST API can be used directly or it's possible to use one of the integration plugins those we have developed for popular e-commerce systems such as Magento, Shopware and etc.

For now we have "ready to implement" **solutions for the next e-commerce CMSs and systems**:

-   **Magento 1** (tested on: )
-   **Magento 2** (tested on:)
-   **Shopware** (tested on:)
-   **Prestashop 1.5** (tested on: )
-   **Prestashop 1.6 - 1.7** (tested on: )
-   **WooCommerce** (tested on: )
-   **OXID eShop** (tested on: )
-   **JTL Shop**
-   **xt:Commerce**
-   **Shopify**
-   **DanDomain**
-   **Weebly**

To have easy supported and scaled structure payment integrations are divided by channels as it described in API doc. For custom integrations we provide "other_shopsystem" channel.

To be sure of the quality of the provided plugins integrations we follow **a few principles in our solutions**:

-   **clear code style** - we use vendors code styles guides for automation code style review and obligatory human code style review as well ;
-   **well tested code** - we use Behat and PHPUnit for testing of our plugins;
-   **continuous integration** - clear Jira flow, payever CI server and the automation deployment and testing system;
-   **continuous delivery** - we use well tuned Jira flow to divide the development process into stages and have up to date solutions any moment of the time.
